# Car Price Prediction based on the Price Distribution in Slovenia

The project presents an end to end data project ranging from data gathering, data cleaning, manipulation, transformation and finally based on the distilled data concludes with a few machine learning models.

## Demo

A demo version of the application is available at: https://slo-car-price-prediction.herokuapp.com/ Currently, due to size limitations of trained models only an XGBoost model is available. With an r2 score of 95% and an RMSE score of 2041, the model makes an average error of 2000â‚¬, hence it is not suitable for real-world applications. Improving the performance of the model is on the agenda.

  
## Roadmap

- Additional inference capability (price based on images and raw text)

- Improving the accuracy of the model (waiting for more data)
